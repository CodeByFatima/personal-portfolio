We created a folder on our local machine and opened it in the VS Code editor.
Then, we moved into the terminal and connected the project (or the local machine) with GitHub.
To do this, we moved into the project directory and ran the command "git init".
After checking with the command "ls -a" which lists all files, including hidden ones,we saw that Git was now tracking our project.
Then we created our desired files, which in our case were the HTML and CSS files.
We added them as usual using the command "git add ." (git add all).
Then we committed those files using the command: "git commit -m "wrote our message""
After committing, it was time to connect it to GitHub.
We used the HTTPS link from our GitHub repo, and then we pushed our content there
and boom, we were live yaay
